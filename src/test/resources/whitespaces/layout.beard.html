{{# the {{block head}}, {{yield}} and {{/block}}:
      - if before the tag there is an EOL followed by 0 or more spaces (or beginning of the file followed by 0 or more spaces) and the tag is followed by EOL
        - should render an EOL
      - otherwise, should not match anything but itself (keep spaces and EOLs)

    the same rules should apply to the comment blocks so in this case, the rendered file should only have one EOL at the beginning
